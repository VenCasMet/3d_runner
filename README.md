🏃‍♂️ 3D Runner Game

A 3D endless runner–style game built to practice game mechanics, player control, obstacle interaction, and scoring logic in a simple but structured environment.The project focuses on core gameplay logic rather than heavy assets or advanced effects, making it ideal for demonstrating fundamentals of 3D game development.

🎮 Game Overview

The player controls a character running forward along a striped 3D track.

The objective is to:

-Move forward continuously

-Avoid or interact with obstacles

-Collect items

-Maximize score before failing

The game gradually becomes more challenging as the player progresses.

🧠 Core Mechanics Implemented

🕹️ Player Movement

-Continuous forward motion

-Player-controlled lateral movement

-Jump mechanics to avoid obstacles

🧱 Obstacles

-Static obstacles placed along the track

-Collision detection determines:

--Game continuation

--Game over state

🎁 Collectibles

-Items placed strategically

-Collection increases score or progression

📈 Scoring System

-Score increases based on:

--Distance traveled

--Items collected

-Score resets on game restart

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Unity (3D)

-C# – Game logic

-Basic 3D assets

-Collision detection

-Player controller scripts

⚙️ Game Logic Flow

-Game starts on user input

-Player moves forward automatically

-Input controls lateral movement & jumping

-Collision checks run every frame

-Score updates continuously

-Collision with blocking obstacle ends the game



📚 What This Project Demonstrates

-Understanding of 3D coordinate systems

-Player controller implementation

-Collision-based game logic

-Continuous game loop handling

-Clean separation of movement, scoring, and collision logic
